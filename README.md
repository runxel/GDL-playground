# [GDL-playground](https://github.com/runxel/GDL-playground)
Playground for my GDL objects. Acts like pile of snippets/Demo objects. So if you see something of interest: Go and grab it, salvage what you need and use it in your own projects.

[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)  
No support, no maintenance. . _Your mileage may vary._  
It's just for learning, folks.

## [Dyn Hotspots](objects/Dyn%20Hotspots)
![Dependencies](https://img.shields.io/badge/dependencies-none-a9dfbf?style=flat-square)

Explains how dynamic hotspots (in an array) work.


## [Get User Language](objects/Get-Language)
![Compatibility](https://img.shields.io/badge/compatibility-tbd-lightgrey?style=flat-square&logo=archicad&logoColor=white)
![Dependencies](https://img.shields.io/badge/dependencies-none-a9dfbf?style=flat-square)

See [full article](https://lucasbecker.de/posts/detecting-user-s-language-via-gdl) on how to detect (kinda) the language the user might speak.


## [Image Filter](objects/Image-Filter)
![Compatibility](https://img.shields.io/badge/compatibility-18_â–²-lightgrey?style=flat-square&logo=archicad&logoColor=white)
![Dependencies](https://img.shields.io/badge/dependencies-none-a9dfbf?style=flat-square)

DEMO for a image filter process. The filter (via a prefix) serves to limit the otherwise very large and performance-heavy image selection in a GDL object.


## [Rounded Prisma](objects/Rounded-Prisma)
![Compatibility](https://img.shields.io/badge/compatibility-21_â–²-lightgrey?style=flat-square&logo=archicad&logoColor=white)
![Dependencies](https://img.shields.io/badge/dependencies-yes-ff7979?style=flat-square)

This object is a demo for a modeling case where you have two vectors with their angles and need a rounded corner where those vectors meet. How to get the _coordinates_?
The solution is to offset the vectors by the radius and offset their intersection point back onto the original vectors.

Note: uses the ["BasicGeometricCalc" macro](http://gdl.graphisoft.com/tips-and-tricks/calling-basicgeometriccalc-macro), which is now deprecated. Could easily be rewritten to use the newer, dict-based ["BasicGeometry" macro](http://gdl.graphisoft.com/tips-and-tricks/using-basicgeometry-macro).

## [Unique Array](objects/Unique-Array/Unique-Array.gdl)
![Dependencies](https://img.shields.io/badge/dependencies-none-a9dfbf?style=flat-square)

Demo code for a way to ensure there are no duplicate items inside an onedimensional array.


## [WÃ¤hlscheibe | Rotary dial](objects/WÃ¤hlscheibe)
![Compatibility](https://img.shields.io/badge/compatibility-23_â–²-lightgrey?style=flat-square&logo=archicad&logoColor=white)
![Dependencies](https://img.shields.io/badge/dependencies-none-a9dfbf?style=flat-square)

If you ever were in need to dial from Archicad. Just a Demo object to explore some concepts, e.g. using a hotspot based interface to let the user input things when in plan.  
_Note: Object doesn't actually call anybody, sadly._ ðŸ˜¢

## Further references
I dump some GDL insights here. 

### Basic Stuff

- To automagically get a proper font selection make a new string parameter and name it `fontType`.  
But what if you need to specify multiple font faces? Also working automatically are `fontTypeHeader`, `fontTypeText`, `fontTypeWatermark`, `strFontTypeCustOrig`and `strFontTypeID` â€“ and possibly more, used by GS-scripted objects.  
If that's still not enough do the following in the parameter script (with `myFontFace` being a string parameter):
```
! param script !
dim fontNames[]
n = request("FONTNAMES_LIST", "", fontNames)
values "myFontFace" fontNames, CUSTOM
```
- You can't pass parameters or arguments to subroutines. Instead you have to fall back to something I call "nasty caller":  
```
if x = y then
	nasty_caller = 1
else
	nasty_caller = 2
endif
gosub "mysubroutine"
END !----------------------------!

"mysubroutine":
	i = foo * nasty_caller
	! (...)
return
```
- [How to put an INFIELD over an UI_PICT in User Interface?](https://archicad-talk.graphisoft.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=69617):  
You have to write the `UI_INFIELD` twice into your UI script: once before and once after the `UI_PICT` command.
- Due to the nature of floating point math comparing 2 real numbers might not yield the result you think. `if real_a = real_b â€¦` and therelike will result in the GDL editor yelling at you. To circumvent any errors you should rather subtract the two values and check if the result falls short of a specified [machine epsilon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_epsilon), mostly abbreviated as `eps` in GDL code.
A very detailed structure could look like this:
```
dict EPS
EPS.length	= 0.0001				! 1/10 mm
EPS.square	= EPS.length**2
EPS.scalar	= EPS.square
EPS.angle	= acs(1 - EPS.scalar)	! 0.0081Â°
```
Determining if two numbers are the same would look like this now:
```
if (real_a - real_b) < EPS.length then [...] 
```

### Advanced

- Place a label there, where the user has actually clicked (having no marker):
```
if not(LABEL_HAS_POINTER) then
	add2  LABEL_POSITION [2][1]	+ LABEL_POSITION [3][1],
		  LABEL_POSITION [2][2]	+ LABEL_POSITION [3][2]
endif
```
